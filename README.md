* Log Expenses - CRUD (Create, Review, Update, and Delete)
* Gallery - Utilizes CSS to improve user expeirence
* Staff - Uses Async Random Person Data, which manipulates the DOM using JavaScript
* Order - Incorporates JavaScript to respond with order data
* Contact - Uses Node and Express to send data input

## Backend
The backend uses REST API. It contains model and controller files. These contain methods that interact with Mongoose to store and manipulate data provided by user input.
