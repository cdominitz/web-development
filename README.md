# Personal Webpage for Web Development Class

## Description
The goal of this project was to learn about the frontend and backend of web development through creating a full-stack MERN app that has CRUD functionality.

### Frontend
The frontend file contains a ReadME that explains how to run the application. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The website has multiple pages that each use a different web development skill:
- **Home Page**: Information about the creation of this web application.
- **Topics**: Discusses topics related to Web Development, such as Web Servers, Frontend Design, and Usability.
- **Log Expenses**: CRUD (Create, Review, Update, and Delete).
- **Gallery**: Utilizes CSS to improve user experience.
- **Staff**: Uses Async Random Person Data, which manipulates the DOM using JavaScript.
- **Order**: Incorporates JavaScript to respond with order data.
- **Contact**: Uses Node.js and Express to send data input.

### Backend
The backend uses REST API. It contains model and controller files. These contain methods that interact with Mongoose to store and manipulate data provided by user input.
